        <h3>Blackend Death metal band from Taipei, Taiwan</h3>
        <p>Chthonic (sometimes typeset ChthoniC or ChThoniC)
            is a Taiwanese heavy metal band, formed in 1995 in Taipei.
        </p>
        <p>
            They have been called "the Black Sabbath of Asia.
            The group incorporates influences from traditional Taiwanese music,
            including adaptations of folk songs and the use of traditional instruments,
            most notably the erhu (often called the hiân-á [絃仔] in the band's native Taiwanese Hokkien).
        </p>
          <p>Their stated goal is to use their music to bring ancient history and mythology into the modern era
              especially to build awareness of the myths of Taiwan and tragic events in that country's history
              (for example, those experienced by the Seediq people).

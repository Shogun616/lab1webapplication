        <p>We at Legion of Doom dedicate to all things Metal. From the early years of Heavy Metal like Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, through the new wave of British Heavy Metal like Iron maiden and beyond.</p>
        <p>Since its foundation in 2021, we want to gather every metal band across the globe into a single site in order
            to help metal fans (Both old and new) to find there next band to become a fan of.</p>
        <p>But we also want to give both the known, obscure and new band a opportunity to reach out to more fans, as well have full control of there content.</p>
